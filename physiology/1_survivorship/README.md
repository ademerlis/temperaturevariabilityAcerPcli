After the one-month temperature treatment, all corals (control and variable-treated) were subjected to a rapid heat-stress assay (CBASS). During CBASS and in the days following, many corals experienced rapid tissue loss and ultimately died. 

Initially, I recorded these in different categories (and also recorded which ones were completely sacrificed due to tissue sampling):

However, all the ones labeled as "dead" also succumbed to rapid tissue loss (RTL), so in order to compare proportions of corals which experienced RTL following CBASS to see if there are any patterns, I collapsed the different categories into all encompassing "RTL".
