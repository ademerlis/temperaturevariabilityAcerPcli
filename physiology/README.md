# Results

## Calcification

The buoyant weight technique (Davies 1989) was used to measure changes in coral density over time. Measurements were taken at the beginning and end of the one-month temperature treatment period. Since the treatment was only one month, we did not expect to see significantly higher growth rates between treatments. 

Our results indeed show that the percent change in mass was not significantly different between control and treated corals of either species.
