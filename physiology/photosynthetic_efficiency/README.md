There are so many ways I can plot the photosynthetic efficiency of the corals in the temperature treatment and the CBASS. I'm not sure which visualization is best, so I'm going to put all of them here for now.

## 1. Raw Fv/Fm during the 28-d temperature treatment period (repeated measures).

## 2. Decline of Fv/Fm over treatment period, normalized to initial measurement

## 3. Spread of normalized Fv/Fm data at the end of the treatment period.

## 4. Reduction of Fv/Fm over 28-d Treatment, normalized to initial measurement

## 3. Dose-Response Curves Following Acute Heat Stress using CBASS

## Statistical model outputs

For Acer, there is a significant effect of treatment on Fv/Fm values:

For Pcli, there is no significant difference between treatments:
