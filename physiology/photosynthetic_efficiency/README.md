There are so many ways I can plot the photosynthetic efficiency of the corals in the temperature treatment and the CBASS. I'm not sure which visualization is best, so I'm going to put all of them here for now.

## 1. Raw Fv/Fm during the 28-d temperature treatment period (repeated measures).

Stats for raw Fv/Fm:


## 2. Decline of Fv/Fm over treatment period, normalized to initial measurement

Plot points as scatterplot and then do line of best fit and get slope of line and test significance of slope

## 3. Spread of normalized Fv/Fm data at the end of the treatment period.
