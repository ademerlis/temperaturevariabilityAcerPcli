**1) Acclimation** 

_Acropora cervicornis_ genotypes (BC-8b, MB-B, and SI-C) were collected from the Rescue a Reef nursery (25.6763° N, 80.0987° W) on Feb 23, 2022 and brought back to Experimental Reef Laboratory at UM/CIMAS/AOML. The next day, the genotypes were cut into 5 cm fragments using a Griffin diamond bandsaw, and apical tips were removed from all fragments. Branches were also removed from all fragments.

The second species used in this study was _Pseudodiploria clivosa_, and the three colonies were rescued from a seawall project in the Port of Miami (25.77044° N, 80.15235° W) on Feb 4, 2022. The larger colonies were cut into approximately 5 cm^2 fragments on Feb 17, 2022. For both species, corals were affixed to an acylic tile with a unique identifier using marine superglue, then given approximately 30 days days to recover from fragmentation and acclimate to the laboratory setting. The tank temperatures were set to 24ºC to mimic *in-situ* temperatures at the time of collection. During this recovery period, initial physiological measurements and genetic samples were taken.

**2) Temperature Treatment**

The 150 Acer and 150 Pcli fragments were randomly assigned to one of four 90-L glass aquaria and either the stable or variable treatment. The variable treatment involved a 3-h ramp up to 31ºC, followed by a 3-h hold at 31ºC, then a 3-h ramp-down to 28ºC. This cycle occurred twice per day for 28 days. 

All tanks separately:

**3) CBASS**

On April 21, the day before the CBASS, coral IDs were randomly assigned to a CBASS temperature and tank. The tank temperatures were randomly assigned as follows: Tank 1 = 36ºC, Tank 2 = 37ºC, Tank 3 = 32 ºC, Tank 4 = 33ºC, Tank 5 = 35ºC, Tank 6 = 30ºC, Tank 7 = 34ºC, Tank 8 = 28ºC. In order to have each coral species and treatment represented at each CBASS tank temp, Acer and Pcli were mixed together. During the one-month temp treatment, however, Acer and Pcli were kept separate.

**4) Recovery**

Following CBASS, corals were kept in their CBASS-assigned tanks at 28ºC until May 17, when they were randomly assigned to new recovery tanks. At this point, only tanks 3,4,6,7, and 8 were being used for recovery. tanks 1, 2, and 5 no longer had corals.

**5) Traditional Heat-Stress Assay**

On June 15, corals were again randomly assigned to a new tank for the traditional heat-stress assay. For the traditional heat stress (gradual ramp then hold at 32ºC), only tanks 3, 4, 7, and 8 were being used. 32ºC was reached on June 25, and then once corals showed signs of bleaching (color score of D1), rapid tissue loss, or were fully tissue sampled and didn't have enough surface area left, then they were moved to the recovery tank, tank 7, which was kept at 28ºC for the entire time.
