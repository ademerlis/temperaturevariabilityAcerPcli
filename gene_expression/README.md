*Figure 1.* Temperatures recorded using LabView (ref) every 15-min for 28 d. Red line depicts fluctuating temperature regime (variable) and blue depicts untreated (control) held at 28ºC for the entire period. Arrows at bottom depict time points of tissue sampling (T0 = initial, T1 = one week into treatment, and T2 = one month into treatment).

*Figure 2.* 12 corals per species per time point were sampled during the 28-d temperature treatment. All sampling occurred at the same temperature (28ºC). ~1cm of tissue was collected using bone cutters, then immediately preserved in 1mL of Zymo DNA/RNA Shield.
