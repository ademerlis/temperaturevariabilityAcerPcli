Some coral have shown resilience to bleaching despite recurrent heatwaves. This may be due to acclimatization and stress-hardening in highly variable environments. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear, particularly when determining resilience of propagated coral species in restoration efforts. We evaluated whether variable temperature confers thermotolerance for two threatened Caribbean coral species (Acropora cervicornis and Pseudodiploria clivosa). We measured holobiont health throughout, then employed a rapid assay to compare thermotolerance of treated versus untreated corals. Photosynthetic efficiency was significantly higher in variable-treated A. cervicornis, but the temperature at which photosynthetic efficiency declined by 50% (ED50) during heat stress was not significantly affected. These results highlight the importance of treatment duration for ex-situ thermal stress-hardening, as well as the potential limitations of rapid assays for elucidating thermotolerance.
